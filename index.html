        <h1>IT SECURITY AWARENESS</h1>
        <p>It seems that you have clicked an unsafe link. This could be a dangerous site, containing malware like a virus or a keylogger.<br> 
        We want to encourage our staff to have awareness in order to avoid sensitive information falling in the wrong hands.<br> Small businesses are unfortunately the most popular target for hackers and you are therefore vulnurable.
        <br> Please read the table below for instructions on what to do and what not to do in terms of IT security. 
       <br>Below are some instructions on how this can be avoided in the future</p>

        <h2>HOW TO AVOID FUTURE ATTACKS</h2>
        <p>In the image below we have highlighted areas for you to inspect in a future email.
    <br>A phishing email will often contain the name of someone you know, your boss or even a family member. 
    This doesn't mean they have their email address, but they randomly or purposly put a name you know as the sender. The senders email address will reveal if it's them or not.
    <br>If the sender is from another company, gmail will mark the mail with a yellow sign saying "external", which is another reason to be alert.
    <br>Lastly, if the sender has a different profile picture than normally, or the image with a question mark, double check if the person changed their profile picture.</p>
