     <h1>IT SECURITY AWARENESS</h1>
        <p>It seems that you have clicked an unsafe link. This could be a dangerous site, containing malware 
        like a virus or a keylogger. We want to encourage our staff to have awareness in order to avoid 
        sensitive information falling in the wrong hands. Small businesses are unfortunately the most popular 
        target for hackers and you are therefore vulnurable. Please read on for instructions on  
        what to do and what not to do in terms of IT security. We want your experience online to be safe and enjoyable.</p>

  <h2>HOW TO AVOID FUTURE ATTACKS</h2>
  <div class="div-bullets">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Observe</b> and be suspicious to email addresses. Does the email address match to mails you have received in the past?</li>
            <li><b>Be critical</b>, a phishing email will often contain the name of someone you know, and in some cases(e.g if the person got hacked) the same email address.</li>     
            <li><b>The story</b>, phishing emails usually tells a story that tries to trick you by giving you a time limit to recover a password or complete a payment. </li> 
            <li><b>Look for signs</b>, If the sender is from another company, gmail will mark the email with a yellow sign saying "external". This is located next to the subject line. </li>
            <li><b>New profile picture</b>, if the sender has a different profile picture than normally, double check if the person changed their profile picture.</li>
            <li><b>Protection is key</b>, use multi-factor authentication when applicabale, use strong passwords and lock your device whenever its left unseen. Dangerous phishing schemes can be done if a hacker gets a hold of your email credentials </li>

      <h2>How to verify that a link is trusted</h2>
      When we receive an email that includes a link, regardless of your trust in the sender, we always reccomend you verifying the link. <b>How do we do this?</b> We have to look at what is called the <b>domain name</b>. <a href="https://pbx.catchthefire.com">pbx.catchthefire.com</a> is a 
      safe link to a safe website. The part that says "catchthefire.com" is what we call the <b>domain name</b> of the website. "pbx" is what we call the <b>prefix</b>. 
      We want to be aware of this before we click on a link. Another example of this is <a href="https://catchthefire.bamboohr.com">catchthefire.bamboohr.com</a>. Bamboohr.com is the <b>domain name</b>, and catchthefire is the <b>prefix</b>. 
      We are aware that bamboohr.com is safe and we can therefore proceed to click any links where bamboohr is displayed as the <b>domain name</b>. Anyhow, the <b>prefix</b> can be a stumbling block, as a hacker can make their website as catchthefire.dangerousdomain.com. 
      "dangerousdomain" might be overlooked because the <b>prefix (catchthefire)</b> seems safe, but thats what conceales the trap. In any case where the <b>domain name</b> is
      unknown, we reccomend you search on google: is "dangerousdomain.com" a safe website? 
      <br>
      <br>
      We do a google search and it turns out "dangerousdomain.com" has been used by scammers previously. <b>What do we do now?</b> Firstly we want to report all phishing schemes to the manager of Technology Services.
      Furthermore you should inform your manager and your coworkers about the scheme, in order to prevent them from walking in the trap you avoided. Lastly, we report the email as phishing in gmail itself, as shown in the image below.
