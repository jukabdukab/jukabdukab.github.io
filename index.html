     <h1>IT SECURITY AWARENESS</h1>
        <p>It seems that you have clicked an unsafe link. This could be a dangerous site, containing malware 
        <br>like a virus or a keylogger. We want to encourage our staff to have awareness in order to avoid 
        <br>sensitive information falling in the wrong hands. Small businesses are unfortunately the most popular 
        <br>target for hackers and you are therefore vulnurable. Please read the table below for instructions on  
        <br>what to do and what not to do in terms of IT security. Below are some instructions on how this can be avoided in the future</p>

        <h2>HOW TO AVOID FUTURE ATTACKS</h2>
        <p>In the image below we have highlighted areas for you to inspect in a future email.
    <br>A phishing email will often contain the name of someone you know, your boss or even a family member. 
    <br>This doesn't mean they have their email address, but they randomly or purposly put a name you know as the sender. 
    <br>Carefully look at the email address. Unless the sender recently changed their address, it should be the same as in previous mails.
    <br>If the sender is from another company, gmail will mark the mail with a yellow sign saying "external", which is another reason to be alert.
    <br>Lastly, if the sender has a different profile picture than normally, or the image with a question mark, double check if the person changed their profile picture.</p>
